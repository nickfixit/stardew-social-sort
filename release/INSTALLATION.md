# Custom Social Sort - Installation Guide

## Quick Install

1. **Install SMAPI** (if you haven't already):
   - Download from [smapi.io](https://smapi.io/)
   - Follow the installation instructions for your platform
   - Make sure you have SMAPI 4.0.0 or later

2. **Install the mod**:
   - Download the latest release zip file
   - Extract the `CustomSocialSort` folder to your `Mods` directory:
     - **Windows**: `%AppData%\StardewValley\Mods\`
     - **Mac**: `~/.config/StardewValley/Mods/`
     - **Linux**: `~/.local/share/StardewValley/Mods/`

3. **Launch the game**:
   - Run Stardew Valley through SMAPI
   - Look for mod loading confirmation in the SMAPI console

## Usage

1. Open the Social tab in-game (ESC â†’ Social)
2. Click the "Custom Sort" button (appears next to existing sort buttons)
3. When active, drag NPCs up and down to reorder them
4. Click the button again to disable custom sorting
5. Your custom order saves automatically with your game

## Troubleshooting

- **Mod not loading**: Check SMAPI console for error messages
- **Button not appearing**: Make sure you're on the Social tab, not Achievements
- **Order not saving**: Check you have write permissions in your save folder
